# MNIST Dataset Classifier and Image Shifting

This repository contains two projects focused on the MNIST dataset: a classifier for digit recognition and a tool for shifting MNIST images.

## Files

- `MNIST Dataset Classifier.ipynb`: This Jupyter notebook contains the implementation of a neural network classifier for the MNIST dataset. It includes data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation.
- `Shift an MNIST image.ipynb`: This Jupyter notebook demonstrates how to shift MNIST images and analyze the impact on classification performance.

## Usage

### 1. Install Dependencies

First, install the required dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Run the Classifier

To train and evaluate the MNIST classifier, open and run the `MNIST Dataset Classifier.ipynb` notebook.

### 3. Shift MNIST Images

To shift MNIST images and observe the results, open and run the `Shift an MNIST image.ipynb` notebook.
